I chose to do noughts and crosses because it was one of the games i played alot at scholl with friends, but also with my younger siblings.
I believe it is a fun game for young children to play to help teach hand to eye cordination but also problem solving skills as if you 
opponent blocks the stratagy you already thought out in your mind in makes you rethink or also come up with more than one solution to win the game

I used HTML to construct the base of what i would like the game to do by letting it know i wanted 9 tiles along with the text i wanted it to display I.E the Play again Button
I then used CSS to construct the board itself once happy the board looked the way it should i then went on to finalise where and how bit i wanted the X and O to be within each tile, i then went on to position the strikethrough on the board for the winner this was a challenge trying and retrying to find the right position for the strike.

I then went on to the JS part of it to construct the game play on the board i had fell into a few difficulties but used the internet to get some help from code speedy which i used a small bit of code for that. I then set up some a couple of sounds for the clicking of the X and O's along with a winning sound which i found from mixkit which is a free 
downlaod site with various sounds that you can search for.

I hope this project is as pleasing to others as it is to myself
